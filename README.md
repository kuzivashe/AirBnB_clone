README FOR AIRBNB CLONE

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT

This is the initial development stages of the AirBnB clone project. We will create a console that we will use to manipulte Objects on our platform such as Places, Cities, Amenities, States, Users and Reviews based in a parent class called BaseModel. We have to ensure that we have an iteractive website. We have to create, update, show, destroy and print the different instanes that are that are on our platform.

DESCRIPTION OF THE COMMAND INTERPRETER

HOW TO START IT

to Start, type

./console.py

Help command:

help command helps you understand each of the commands that we have created. If you want to know all the possible commands, type
help

But if you want to know what is in a specific command you type:

help command like help quit

Create command: If you intend to create a new object, you type:

create <object class>

So the classes that we manage are:

i. BaseModel
ii. User
iii. Amenity
iv. City
v. Place
vi. State
vii. Review

Capital letters have to be taken care of when a class is called.
